## The project & the partner!

Millions of veterans, their families, and caregivers rely on the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for essential benefits and services.
VA’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) makes sure that the
agency's benefits and services are accessible online.

From March 2022 to January 2025, content experts at Bloom Works worked with VA OCTO to scale its content practice. We worked with more than 80 partners and across different business lines in VA. Our goal was to create accurate, consistent, and accessible content on VA.gov to help build more trust.

During our partnership, we improved 44 online forms on VA.gov. Our holistic approach to content inspired our frequent collaborators to hire more content specialists on their own product teams. And this allowed VA to design and deliver better services.


## The challenge

Part of our work included improving the online forms and tools that help
veterans and their loved ones get the benefits they’re entitled to. During
our partnership, we worked on 44 online forms, all with unique challenges.
Many of the forms had confusing language and dense instructions. 

**Moving the paper forms online alone wouldn’t meet the needs of veterans. We needed to change the forms to make them easier to use and understand.** We brought content design best practices to this work, but we viewed our mandate as broader than just content. We focused on improving the overall experience, making everything more consistent, and integrating best practices around trauma-informed designs.
