## The project & the partner

When Bloom Works began working with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in 2022, the agency had been engaged in a multi-year effort to modernize its digital presence. Much of [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) had already migrated to a modern platform. But there was still legacy content to update, restructure, and migrate. As part of our work with VA, we looked at over 350 pages—mostly older pages and dense PDFs—and moved essential content to several hub areas. 

Moving the older pages to VA.gov means that veterans can more easily find what they need on one modern, mobile-responsive platform. And veterans who use a mobile phone or a screen reader can more easily access content that was inaccessible in its PDF or table format before the migration.

Moving these pages gets VA one step closer to sunsetting older sites, saving money and resources. And it supports VA’s mission to deliver clear and accurate content that helps veterans and their family members get the benefits they deserve.

Most of our content migration work at VA followed a consistent pattern:

* Identify a collection of legacy content—often dozens of pages about a particular benefit like education or health care.
* Begin a careful process of inventory and audit.
* Determine what was still relevant and accurate, what needed updating, and what we could archive.
* Draft new content for 

  [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)

  's modern platform. This meant rewriting complex requirements into clear, actionable information while maintaining technical accuracy.
* Work with our information architecture specialists to figure out where on the site the new content belonged. After we published the pages, we set up redirects to the new pages and updated navigation menus.

We made a lot of progress, but it wasn’t always easy. After moving through several phases of this work, we reflected a bit on why the work sometimes felt difficult and how we could do things differently in future projects.
