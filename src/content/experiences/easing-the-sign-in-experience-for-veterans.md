## In brief

### Partner

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) - Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO).

### Challenge

The VA planned to update its sign-in account options across VA.gov to help simplify and secure the sign-in process. They needed to carry out a comprehensive content strategy to move from 4 sign-in account options to 2, and to minimize disruption for millions of veterans.

### Impact

We created clear guidelines, consistent language, and user-friendly instructions for both veterans and product teams creating content across VA.gov. Our content strategy—informed by in-person research efforts—helped veterans transition to the 2 secure sign-in account options before any options were taken away.

By early 2025, sign-ins with the legacy accounts dropped dramatically, and sign-ins with ID.me and Login.gov accounts increased substantially. Our efforts allowed millions of veterans to navigate VA.gov and access their benefits online. And it helped prevent scammers from stealing someone else’s benefits.
